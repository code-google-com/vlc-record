I've added two wikis which describe [how to build vlc-record](BuildVLCRecord.md) (and the needed [vlc player](BuildVlcPlayer.md)) at your own.

There is a new mini [howto](NewVersionOnUbuntu.md) that should help running VLC-Record 2.xx on Ubuntu 9.10. I'll also update the binary packages for this tutorial because there is a small problem in the player package, but the change is only cosmetic so you can try this package right now.
